# VulkanNET

Originally I was working off a fork of Jörg's work (https://github.com/jwollen/SharpVulkan), but wanted to deviate to provide a more traditional C# interface without requiring the devs using it to have to a lot of boiler plate code.

## Usage
The package is available as a NuGet Package ().  Tested on Windows 10 in a .NET 4.7.1 WPF Application.

## Examples
I'm using this library as part of my new on-going series on Vulkan, https://github.com/jcapellman/vulkandeepdive.
